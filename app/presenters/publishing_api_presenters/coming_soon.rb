# A temporary content format used as a splash page for scheduled documents.
#
# When a piece of content is scheduled for publication, a "coming_soon" content
# item is pushed to the Publishing API, along with a `PublishIntent` for the
# scheduled publication time. This is to get around the fact that the current
# caching infrastructure will cache a 404 for 30 minutes without honouring any
# upstream caching headers it receives. By publishing a temporary "coming soon"
# page, we can get around this issue and ensure that the cache headers that are
# set according to the scheduled publication time will be honored, thus
# preventing a 404 page from being cached for up to 30 minutes from the point
# the document was published.
#
# Note this format becomes redundant once the caching infrasture is able to
# honour caching headers on upstream 404 responses.
