    # `details` instead of the top-level `links` hash because topics are not yet
    # being registered in the content store. Once they are available in the
    # content store, the `links` hash should be used instead.
    #
    # Note also that the `browse_pages` key is here as a marker for a future
    # feature where email alerts will be generated based on taggings to browse
    # pages. Again, this should be moved to the `links` hash at the earliest
    # possible time.
